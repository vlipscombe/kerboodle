						<h2>What is the Administrator for?</h2>
							<p><strong>Multiple departments</strong> using different courses can all purchase access to products at <a href="http://www.kerboodle.com">http://www.kerboodle.com</a>. Having one administrative user ensures that each student and teacher only has <strong>one set of login details</strong> to get to all of their courses.</p>

							<p>The Administrator does not have access to the content of courses - their only responsibility is <strong>creating user accounts</strong> and global groups (groups that exist across the whole institution).</p>

							<p>The Administrator should not purchase products for the institution. Ideally, teachers should purchase products to be used within their department, but where this isn’t possible, the Administrator should purchase products using a different email address to that which has been used to set up their Administrator account. Please note that doing this will create a new Teacher account.</p>

							<p>Your Administrator should be someone who is <strong>familiar with your School Management System</strong>, so that they can easily export student data and create student logins in your online product.</p>

</p><p>If you do not receive this prompt, or you can see that there are already some students in the User Management module, then your institution already has an Administrator. To find out who they are, click on your name at the very top of the screen. Scroll to the bottom of the My Profile window that opens, and the Administrator’s details will be shown at the bottom.

A school can only have one Administrator per institution, so if a Teacher is willing to take on this role then they will have to be the Administrator for any of the courses the institution purchases. 
</p><p>You will need to register twice to be both Administrator and a Teacher user, and will therefore need two different email addresses.

			                      		<p>Your Administrator should be able to confidently use your School Management System and have a good general understanding of your school structure. Ideally they would be quite IT literate - but the Administrator task is very small, and not complicated, so this is not imperative. The tasks for the Administrator will be short and infrequent, so should not be a burden.</p>

			                      		<p><strong>A:  </strong><p>As an Administrator you can create multiple student users by importing a CSV file. Using our <a href='../downloads/template.csv' alt='CSV Template' >CSV Template</a> you can populate student users by exporting them from your School Management System and placing them into the CSV file. Any Global Groups listed in the CSV file that do not already exist in kerboodle (such as Years, Forms and Class) will be automatically generated during the import process and the students will then be automatically assigned to those groups. 
</p><p>When you log in with your Administrator details you will be directed straight onto the <em>School Users </em>tab. Once you are on this screen, click on the <em>CSV</em> drop down menu in the centre console. If you haven't already downloaded and populated the <a href='../downloads/template.csv' alt='CSV Template' >CSV Template</a>  then click <em>Download CSV Template</em>. If you have populated the template then click Import CSV and browse to find the CSV file you created. 
</p><p>When the CSV file is processed, the usernames and passwords for the students will be automatically generated as the first letter from their first name and their full surname. 
</p><p>For example 
</p><p>Name<b> </b>- Peter Smith
</p><p>Username - psmith
</p><p>If another student has the same initials and surname then any additional users will be automatically assigned a number to their username after import.  
</p><p>For example
</p><p>Name -<b> </b>Paul Smith
</p><p>Username - psmith2    
</p><p>You can manually edit their usernames after import if you wish to change the format.  
</p><p>A student password will be set to their username before first login. When the students first access the product they will be prompted to change their password. The institution code is always the same for every user within that institution. For an easy way to remember your institution code, you might like to download, print and fill in this <a href='../downloads/login-poster.pdf' target="_blank" alt='Institution Code Poster' >Institution Code Poster</a> for display in classrooms.
</p><p>See below for more information about the CSV process.

			                      		<p><strong>A:  </strong><p>As an Administrator you can create multiple student users by importing a CSV file. Using our <a href='../downloads/template.csv' alt='CSV Template'>CSV Template</a> you can populate student users by exporting them from your School Management System and placing them into the CSV file. Any Global Groups listed in the CSV file that do not already exist in kerboodle (such as Years, Forms and Class) will be automatically generated during the import process and the students will then be automatically assigned to those groups. 
</p><p>When you log in with your Administrator details you will be directed straight onto the <em>School Users</em> tab. Once you are on this screen, click on the <em>CSV</em> drop down menu in the centre console. If you haven't already downloaded and populated the <a href='../downloads/template.csv' alt='CSV Template' >CSV Template</a>  then please click Download CSV Template. If you have populated the template then click Import CSV and browse to find the CSV file you created. 
</p><p>When the CSV file is processed, the usernames and passwords for the students will be automatically generated as the first letter from their first name and their full surname. 
</p><p>For example 
</p><p>Name<b> </b>- Peter Smith
</p><p>Username - psmith
</p><p>If another student has the same initials and surname then any additional users will be automatically assigned a number to their username after import.  
</p><p>For example
</p><p>Name -<b> </b>Paul Smith
</p><p>Username - psmith2    
</p><p>You can manually edit their usernames after import if you wish to change the format.  
</p><p>A student password will be set to their username before first login. When the students first access the product they will be prompted to change their password. The institution code is always the same for every user within that institution. For an easy way to remember your institution code, you might like to download, print and fill in this <a href='../downloads/login-poster.pdf' target="_blank" alt='Institution Code Poster' >Institution Code Poster</a> for display in classrooms.
