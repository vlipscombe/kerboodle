										<li>Most licences for products on new Kerboodle will automatically be renewed, so you never have to worry about losing access. You will receive plenty of notice of this renewal, and always have the option to cancel.</li>
										<li>Every course has a built-in course homepage, to give you updates and advice on your products, course and subject.</li>

	                      		<p>If you used to use the student self-registration function don’t worry - It is very simple to create new user accounts directly in Kerboodle. This process is handled by the school’s single new Kerboodle Administrator (we recommend a data manager, or IT technician, if possible) and is a simple spreadsheet upload. This <a href="../administrator/gettingstarted">Getting started guide</a> for the Administrator will take you through the steps. You can find out more about the Administrator on the <a href="../administrator">Administrator help pages.</a></p>

	                      		<p>From September you will be able to give students access to the courses, and the correct groups, by creating group codes, just like in current Kerboodle.</p>

	                  		<div class="question_answer">
	                      		<p><strong>A:  </strong>A lot of the administration will be similar, but there is one key difference. In current Kerboodle multiple teachers in your school can actually be Teachers/Admins. In new Kerboodle only one Administrator account can be held.</p>

	                      		<p>Having more than one admin user, who is allowed to create student accounts, led to complications with students having more than one set of login details, or one staff member deleting or altering the accounts created by another.</p>

	                      		<p>In new Kerboodle, group management is still easily controlled by individual teachers, but there is only one Administrator in the whole school. Their only task is to create user accounts on behalf of the teachers.</p>

	                      		<p>They can easily bulk create student accounts using the upload function. We strongly recommend that you nominate a data manager, IT Technician, or other central, technically-confident person to carry out this role.</p>

							<p><strong>Q:  </strong>Why does new Kerboodle only allow one Administrator?</p>
						</div>	
						<div class="question_container">
	                  		<div class="question_answer">
	                      		<p><strong>A:  </strong>We understand that this is a significant change to your previous Kerboodle experience, but it was made with the day-to-day experience of teachers and students being of primary concern.</p>

	                      		<p> Many schools have a number of departments that use Kerboodle courses, and a student may be accessing Kerboodle throughout their school years. With more than one Administrator schools frequently experience difficulties with students and teachers having more than one login for their different courses, or with one staff member accidentally making changes to other department’s users. </p>

	                      		<p>Equally, a number of teachers found themselves manually creating all of their student accounts as they weren’t sure how to manage a bulk account creation. </p>

	                      		<p>New Kerboodle has been designed to only require one Administrator - who needs to do a minimal amount of work. Course access and Group creation can both be handled by Teachers.</p>

	                      		<p>We strongly recommend that your Administrator is very comfortable with using your School Management System (e.g. SIMs) - ideally they will be a Data Manager or IT Technician. That way they should find the simple CSV upload to Kerboodle very straightforward, and will easily and quickly create unique accounts for the students and teachers that need it. They can therefore help to ensure that all users in your school have a streamlined experience across all of their courses.</p>
