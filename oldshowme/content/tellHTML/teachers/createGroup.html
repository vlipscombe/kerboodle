		<h3><a href="#"><b>What are Teaching Groups and why are they needed?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>When students are set up on Kerboodle, they are not given access to a Kerboodle Book or Course automatically; they need to be assigned.</p>
			<p>Teaching Groups are what Kerboodle uses to determine which books and courses each student is able to access. Students can be in more than one Teaching Group so they need just one login for all of their subjects.</p>
			<p>You can use the Teaching Groups to really personalise your students' learning - you could create new Teaching Groups for different ability bandings, after school classes or subject cohorts. You can create as many groups as you wish.</p>
			<p><font color= '#C3005E'><b>How?</b></font> For step-by-step instructions, please have a look at our <b>Show Me How</b> tutorial: <a href="showMeHow.html?teachers??createGroupT" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','width=800,height=600,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes');return false;"><font color='#39A4DD'><b>Creating a Teaching Group</b></font></a></p>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>What is Group Code?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>A Group Code option appears as an additional field available to you when creating or editing your Teaching Groups.</p>
			<p>Using Group Code is really handy as it reduces the amount of time you have to spend setting up the Teaching Group. You only have to add the Courses and Books the students need access to and don't need to add any students at all. Simply tell your students what the code is and let them attach themselves to the group!</p>
			<p>To see the student view of using Group Codes, please have a look at our <b>Show Me How</b> tutorial: <a href="showMeHow.html?teachers??studentGroupT" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank','width=800,height=600,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes');return false;"><font color='#39A4DD'><b>Students view of Group Code</b></font></a></p>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>Updating and Editing Teaching Groups</b></a></h3>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>Changing a student's password</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>In order to create, edit and delete accounts, you must have Teacher Administrator access to Kerboodle.</p>
			<p>However, if your students are experiencing difficulties logging into Kerboodle, with Teacher access you are able to check their username and reset their password.</p>

Click on their name so the details appear on the right hand side. Click on the <b>Change Password</b> link and follow the instructions on screen to complete this.</p>
