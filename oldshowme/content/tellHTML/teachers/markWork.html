		<h3><a href="#"><b>What reports and marks are available from an assignment?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>When completing interactive activities from the course as part of the Assignment, students will receive feedback from Kerboodle as to how well they have done and in some cases, which pages of the student book they need to go back to in order to revise.</p>
			<p>These marks and comments, however, will not be shown to you as part of the Assignment. The interactive activities are designed more for the students' independent learning.</p>
			<p>Test Yourself activities are marked by Kerboodle automatically, and when creating an assignment you have the option to ask for students to return a document to you.</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>Marking Assignments</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>If you've asked that students can return a document to you, then you will have the option to open it and score it from the Marking screens.</p>
			<p>All Test Yourself activities will be automatically marked by Kerboodle, and the result will be available in the Mark screen.</p>
			<p>If an assignment contains both a Test Yourself and a returned document, then the two results will combine to give an overall score for the assignment. This then creates tracking information which you can use to measure the progress of your students.</p>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>Tracking your students' progress</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>There are two ways that you can use Kerboodle to track your students' progress:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><b>Student Results & Progress Report:</b> This allows you to see an overview of an individual student's progress throughout the year. This will show the results of both Test Yourself activities and Assignments.</li>
			<li><b>Reports:</b> This allows you to see reports for both individual students and entire groups, but you cannot see an overall average for the year. The reports tab will show the reports for both Test Yourself activities and assignment reports.</li> 
			</ol>
