		<div>
			<p>When a school orders Kerboodle, the subscriptions are registered to the school, rather than the teacher, so all Kerboodle Books and Courses appear under the same organisation code. This means that Kerboodle can be used as a whole school solution, rather than just an individual teacher's resource.</p>
			<p>If other departments in your school are using Kerboodle, it may be that you want to hide their Courses and Books from your homepage.</p>
			<p><font color= '#C3005E'><b>How?</b></font> Click on the <b>Manage Courses</b> tab and tick the boxes next to courses and books you'd like to hide, then click on the <b>Hide on homepage</b> button.</p>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>What are copy courses and why should I use them?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>You can use Kerboodle to edit a course to make it personalised for your students. Original courses can't be edited, as they can be used by all the other Teachers on the organisation. So to be able to edit the course, you will need to make your own copy of it first.</p>
			<p><font color= '#C3005E'><b>How?</b></font> Click on the <b>Manage Courses</b> tab then click on the drop down arrow alongside the course and select <b>Copy this course</b>.</p>
			<p><b>Please note:</b> Copied versions of Kerboodle Courses will not be updated with any new resources that are added to the course after it has been copied.</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>Editing the course</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>You can edit the course in various ways, for example:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>You could hide a future unit or topic, or hide all of the worksheets, to show or assign at a later date.</li>
			<li>You can change the name of the unit or chapter folders to make them more relevant to your teaching style.</li>
			<li>You can combine any Nelson Thornes resources with those you have uploaded to the My Resources section of the copy course to make one complete course.</li>
			</ul>
