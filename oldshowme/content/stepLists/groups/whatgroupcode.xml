			<p>Enabling and entering a Group Code for your Teaching Group is really handy. It reduces the amount of time you have to spend setting up the Teaching Group as you only have to add the Courses and Books the students need access to.</p>
			<p>You don't need to add any students at all, you can simply tell your students what the code is and let them log in and attach themselves to the group!</p>
