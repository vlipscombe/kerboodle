		<h3><a href="#"><b>What are Assignments?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>Your teachers might use Kerboodle to set assignments for you. They might assign you a lesson you have worked through in class, or set an assignment with a homework task or revision activities.</p>
			<p>The good thing about assignments is that all your resources can be accessed in one window through a menu, so you don't need to search the library for all the activities.</p>
			<p>Once assigned, they will appear on your course page or <b>Today's Events</b> panel so you can keep track of your workload.</p>
			<p>You can send work back through assignments for your teacher to mark. Your teacher will use these marks to track your progress.</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>Accessing your Assignments</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>Any current assignments will appear in the Today's Events panel, or they can also be accessed through the course page.</p>
			<p>Just click on the assignment title and it will open in a new window. Use the Menu bar to move between the resources within the assignment.</b>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>Return work as part of an Assignment</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>When you complete your assignment, any Test Yourself marks will automatically be returned to your teacher, but you may also have the option to send a file back to them for marking (for example, a worksheet).</p>
			<p>If you have been asked to complete a worksheet that has been assigned to you, you will need to save a copy first before completing the worksheet. Alternatively, your teacher might ask you to create your own file to submit.</p>
			<p>Once you have completed your work, use the Menu bar to go back to the Introduction page and use the Browse button* to find the file to submit back to your teacher.</p>
			<p><i>*If the Browse button is greyed out, your teacher has not requested that you return a document.</i></p>
