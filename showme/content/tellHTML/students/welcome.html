			<p>These 'Tell Me How' guides have been designed to tell you everything you need to know about using Kerboodle.</p>
			<p>You're currently logged into Kerboodle as a Student. If you're a student at a school or college, your Kerboodle Organisation can be used for all subjects, so you should only ever need this one account to access all of your courses. If courses are missing from your homepage, or if you experience any problems with Kerboodle or your account, you should speak with your teacher in the first instance.</p>
			<p>Follow the steps above to work through the process we recommend to get started.</p>
