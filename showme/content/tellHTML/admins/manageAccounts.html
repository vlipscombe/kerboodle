		<h3><a href="#"><b>Why do I need to manage Student and Teacher accounts?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>Like any application or program where users have their own account, your students' details need to be kept up to date. The process of updating your student accounts can be carried out at any point in the year.</p>
			<p>Account Management allows Kerboodle administrators to:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Edit the registration year and class for the students when they move up a year</li>
			<li>Mark students as 'leavers' when they leave the school - so their reports and accounts will be kept on the system, but they won't be able to log in anymore</li>
			<li>Keep the Organisation looking nice and tidy - ideally, students should only have one account each and they should be easy to find within the system.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>What are the options available to me for managing accounts?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>There are 3 ways you can manage accounts on Kerboodle, so you can choose depending on what information you need to edit.</p>
			<ol>
			<li><b>Editing individual accounts:</b> This is the best option for making changes to one account at a time, and it's the only way you can edit an account's Unique ID.</li>
			<li><b>Exporting and Re-importing multiple accounts:</b> Use this option to edit more than one account at once. You can edit: Usernames, Passwords, First Names, Last Names, Email Addresses, Years, Classes, User Type and Enable or Disable accounts.</li>
			<li><b>Editing multiple accounts on-screen:</b> This option will allow you to edit multiple Students' registration years and classes, delete multiple accounts and set students as leavers.</li>
			</ol>
