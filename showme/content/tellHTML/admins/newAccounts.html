		<h3><a href="#"><b>Important note about Kerboodle accounts:</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>We highly recommend that the tasks of importing and managing accounts are carried out by your main Admin user for Kerboodle. Many schools have more than one department using their Kerboodle Organisation, so somebody such as your Data Manager or Network Manager should really have admin control and carry out these tasks.</p>
			<p>Each Teacher and Student in the school should have their own account to log into Kerboodle. They will only need one set of login details to access any of the courses your school or college has subscribed to.</p>
			<p>There are 3 types of accounts available on Kerboodle: Teacher Administrator, Teacher and Student. Only Teacher Administrators have the ability to create, edit and delete accounts.</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>Creating an individual Student or Teacher Account</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>We recommend that the <b>Create New Account</b> function is only used for creating individual Teacher accounts, or when you need to add an extra Student to Kerboodle.</p>
			<p>We wouldn't recommend this option for organisations that are likely to be importing multiple Students and Teachers in the future. For more information about importing multiple accounts to Kerboodle, please have a look at the <b>Importing Multiple Accounts</b> section.</p>
			<p><font color= '#C3005E'><b>How?</b></font> To create a new account on Kerboodle, access the Admin area and click on the <b>Create New Account</b> button.</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>Importing Multiple Accounts</b></a></h3>
		<div>
		    <p>To make setting up your Student and Teacher accounts as easy as possible, you can import the data as a batch to Kerboodle.</p>
			<p>There are three options for importing accounts:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>A report and template for organisations who use <b>SIMS</b> as their Management Information System</li>
			<li>A report for organisations who use <b>Facility</b> as their Management Information System</li>
			<li>A <b>blank template</b> for organisations who don't use SIMS or Facility.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><font color= '#C3005E'><b>How?</b></font> To import multiple accounts to Kerboodle, access the Admin area and click on the <b>Import Accounts</b> button. Follow the steps in the Kerboodle Import Wizard to import your student accounts.</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a href="#"><b>What is the Unique ID and why is it mandatory for all Students and Teachers?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
            <p>The Unique ID is what Kerboodle uses to prevent duplicate Students and Teachers being imported and is also used to differentiate between Students or Teachers with the same name (this is quite common in larger establishments).</p>
			<p>The Unique ID is also used when editing your Student and Teacher accounts; it is possible to overwrite existing data, for example year and class, with new data, by keeping the Unique ID the same.</p>
			<p>One way of ensuring that the Unique ID is unique to that particular Student or Teacher, is to use the alphanumeric characters that you use in your school management system to identify a Student or Teacher. </p>
