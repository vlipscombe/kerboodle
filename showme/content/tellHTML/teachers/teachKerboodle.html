		<div>
			<p>A lesson is a collection of resources that can all be accessed from one window on Kerboodle. By including these resources in a lesson, it means that you can present the lesson to your class and easily move from one resource to the other without having to search the Kerboodle Library.</p>
			<p>You can choose the order that the resources appear, and also have the option to include your own resources from the My Resources section of Kerboodle. The lessons can also be assigned to students later for revision, or can be used as a catch-up tool for students who have missed the lesson.</p>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>What are Assignments and why should I use them?</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>Assignments are a feature of Kerboodle that allow you to group together various resources and send them to your students to work through on Kerboodle. An assignment is viewed in one window and allows the student to easily move between resources. </p>
			<p>Depending on how you create your assignment, the students can also submit a document (for example a worksheet) to you for marking. This means that you can use the marks from assignments to track your students' progress.</p>

		<h3><a href="#"><b>Sharing Annotations in Kerboodle Books</b></a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>One of the main features of Kerboodle Books is that you can annotate the pages with your own notes, links and highlight areas of text.</p>
			<p>By sharing these annotations with your students, you're giving them access to a personalised copy of the student book that you can update, as and when you cover a topic.</p>
