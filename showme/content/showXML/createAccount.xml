	<topicDialog><![CDATA[<p>We recommend that the <b>Create New Account</b> function is only used for creating individual Teacher accounts, or when you need to add an extra Student to Kerboodle.</p><p>We wouldn't recommend this option for organisations that are likely to be importing multiple Students and Teachers in the future, so if you're unsure, please speak to your data manager or technician about taking on the import process.</p><p>For more information about importing multiple accounts to Kerboodle, please have a look at the <b>Importing Multiple Accounts</b> tutorial.</p>]]></topicDialog>
