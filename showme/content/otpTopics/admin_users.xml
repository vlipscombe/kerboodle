		<intro><![CDATA[
			<p>The admin area on Kerboodle displays all of the Student and Teacher accounts that are set up on your Kerboodle organisation.</p>
			<p>From this page, you can create and import new accounts and manage any existing accounts.</p>
			<p><b>Please note:</b> We highly recommend that the tasks of importing and managing accounts are carried out by one person within your organisation as many schools have more than one department using Kerboodle.</p>
