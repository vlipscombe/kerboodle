			<p>Your Tests tab contains the Nelson Thornes created Tests for your course. These Tests are designed for you to use to assess the knowledge and understanding that your students have for a topic. As they are marked by Kerboodle they are easy to use and will save you time.</p>
			<p>You can either use them to knowledge at the beginning of the topic or find out how much your students have understood at the end. The results will allow you to intervene and support students who have not understood; they will also give you (and your students) confidence in the knowledge that they have acquired.</p>
			<p>You can assign these tests to your students and add them to your Kerboodle lessons or Assignments; you can also adapt them by creating custom Tests (containing a set of questions chosen from within these Tests).</p>
