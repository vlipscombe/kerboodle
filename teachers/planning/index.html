You move through the slides one screen at a time, using the Next and Back buttons on the bottom right. The slides may have a panel of resources on the right hand side – these resources can also be found in the Resources module. Click on an item to open it. It will open over the slide.
</p><p>There are tools available for annotating the slides – click on Tools at the bottom of your screen. This will open the Tools menu. Click the button again to close the menu. You can save any annotations you make, or you can delete them individually by using the eraser tool. If you save the annotations, they will automatically appear next time you open the Lesson player. Choose Hide from the Tools menu to hide the annotations.
</p><p>There may also be integrated notes – look to the bottom left of the screen. If there are notes, you will see a tab named Notes. Click on this tab to see the notes. Click on the Lesson tab to return to the slides.
</p><p>If there is a Digital Book associated with this part of the course, then the Digital Book button at the bottom of the screen will be visible. If you have access to this book, then clicking on the button will open the book to the correct page for this Lesson Player item.
</p><p>A Lesson Player object can be visible to students, but students will <i>never</i> be able to access the integrated teacher notes.
</p><p>You can create and edit your own Lesson Player, or edit someone else’s. See the section below called Copy, Move, Edit and Delete to learn how.

</p><p>First enter a title by clicking on the Settings button and typing in the box next to Plan Title. This is the title that will appear in the list in the main course.
</p><p>Underneath the title space are three tabs: Screens, Edit Screen, and Notes.
</p><p><i>Screens</i>
</p><p>The Screens menu allows you to do a few things: add a slide (click on the Add a Screen button), re-order the slides (by clicking on one screen and dragging it into a new position) or delete a slide (click on the screen to select it, then click on the small rubbish bin icon just above the screen thumbnail).
</p><p>When you add a new slide, you can choose which layout you would like it to have. The green area represents the title. The orange area represents a space for text. The blue area represents a space for an image.
</p><p>If you want to change the layout of a slide, click on the small cog icon above the screen thumbnail, in the Screens menu.
</p><p><i>Edit Screen</i>
</p><p>The Edit Screen tab is where you add or change the content of any one slide. You select the slide that you want to work on in the Screens tab.
</p><p>In the Edit Screen tab there are three main areas – text, image, and linked resources.
</p><p>The text area is normally on the left, and a toolbar will be visible above it. These controls are similar to programmes such as Microsoft Word. As well as adding and formatting text, these tools also allow you to add a weblink (using the button named Link, with an image of the globe with a metal link in front, an image, or a table.
</p><p>The area in the middle is usually a space for an image, marked by a dotted line. Click in this area to add an image. Click on Browse to find your file (from your desktop or network) then click Upload. In Edit Screen, click on the image to select it. You can now drag it to move it, or drag the corners to re-size it.
</p><p>The area on the right is always for linking to resources from the Resources module. Click in the area to call up the full list of content available – this includes anything you have uploaded to the course. Use the filters on the left to find the object you would like to link to. Select the object by clicking the tickbox to the left of the title. Then click Add. You can link to more than one object. You can change the order of the linked resources by clicking and dragging to a new position.
