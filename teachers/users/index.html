					<h2>At a glance</h2>
					<p>This section is where you can organise your teaching groups, and reset student passwords. </p>
					<p>If your institution is completely new to the product, you will be asked to invite a system Administrator. Please see our <a href="../gettingstarted"> teachers getting started guide</a> which will help you with the intial setup of Kerboodle.  </p>


					<p>If your institution already has an Administrator, their name will be displayed in your profile (click on your name at the top of the screen).</p>
					<p>To <strong>add users</strong> contact your System Administrator. As a teacher you will still be able to create your own course and assignment groups once your students have been imported into Kerboodle by your Administrator. </p>
					<p>To learn about the student experience visit the <a href="../../students">Student support pages.</a></p>
					<p>If you cannot resolve your query, please <A href="https://global.oup.com/education/help/technical-support/helpdesk-platform" target="_blank">Contact us</A>.</p>

					<h3>Update to the student import process</h3>
					<p>In response to user feedback, we have recently simplified the student import process. The Class column has now been removed from the CSV template file, and the Form column is now optional. </p>
					<p>Please use the updated CSV template file when importing users. You can download this by clicking on the CSV dropdown menu in the centre console and selecting Download CSV template. Please do not remove, reorder or change the column headings.</p>

					<h3> The Administrator role  </h3>

                  		<div class="question_answer">
                      		<p><strong>A: </strong>Multiple departments using different courses can all purchase access to products at <a href="http://www.kerboodle.com">http://www.kerboodle.com</a>. Having one administrative user ensures that each student and teacher only has one set of login details to get to all of their courses.</p>
                      		<p>The Administrator does not have access to the content of courses - their only responsibility is creating user accounts and Global Groups (groups that exist across the whole institution).</p>
                      		<p>Your Administrator should be someone who is familiar with your School Management System, so that they can easily export student data and create student logins in Kerboodle.</p>
                      		<p>Visit the <a href="../../administrator">Administrator support pages</a> to see all of the information available. </p>

                      		<p>Within a course, you can create smaller groups for the purposes of assignments and reporting. These are called <strong>Assignment Groups</strong>, and existing student users can be placed in as many of these groups as you like. Note that these groups will only exist within the course that you are in. To create an Assignment Group:</p>
                      		<ul>
                      			<li>click on Group Access to the top left of your screen</li>
                      			<li>select the group on the left within which you wish to create the group</li>
                      			<li>under the Assignment Groups heading, click Create an Assignment Group</li>
                      			<li>give the Group a name</li>
                      			<li>select the students who should be in the group from the list, by clicking on the rows</li>
                      			<li>click Save, and then Save Changes.</li>
                      		</ul>
                      		<p>Note that only the Administrator can create student accounts. The student needs to have an account before they can be added to/join a group.</p>
