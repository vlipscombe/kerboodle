					<h3> The Administrator role  </h3>

                  		<div class="question_answer">
                      		<p><strong>A: </strong>Multiple departments using different courses can all purchase access to products at <a href="http://www.kerboodle.com">http://www.kerboodle.com</a>. Having one administrative user ensures that each student and teacher only has one set of login details to get to all of their courses.</p>
                      		<p>The Administrator does not have access to the content of courses - their only responsibility is creating user accounts and Global Groups (groups that exist across the whole institution).</p>
                      		<p>Your Administrator should be someone who is familiar with your School Management System, so that they can easily export student data and create student logins in Kerboodle.</p>
                      		<p>Visit the <a href="../../administrator">Administrator support pages</a> to see all of the information available. </p>

                      		<p><strong>A: </strong>If your institution does not already have an Administrator in Kerboodle, you will be prompted to invite one when you visit the User Management module. </p>
                      		<p>If you do not receive this prompt, or you can see that there are already some students in the User Management module, then your institution already has an Administrator. To find out who they are, click on your name at the very top of the screen. Scroll to the bottom of the My Profile window that opens, and the Administrator’s details will be shown at the bottom.</p>
