Having one administrative user ensures that each student and teacher only has one set of login details to get to all of their courses.
</p><p>The Administrator does not have access to the content of courses - their only responsibility is creating user accounts and global groups (groups that exist across the whole institution).
</p><p>Your Administrator should be someone who is familiar with your School Management System, so that they can easily export student data and create student logins for your online product.

			                      		<p><strong>A: </strong><p>Your system Administrator will create the student logins in bulk, by exporting their names and groups from your institutionâ€™s management system.
</p><p>The default usernames are the first letter of the first name, followed by the surname. For example, Sally Smith will have a username of: ssmith
</p><p>If two studentsâ€™ names will create identical usernames, then one of them will have a number automatically added on to the end. Look at their entries in the User Management module to identify these users.
</p><p>For first login, the studentâ€™s password will be the same as their username. The system will force them to change this password when they first log in. It must be 6 characters or more.
</p><p>The students will also need their institution code. This is the same as yours, and is provided to you at the same time as your login details, or by your system Administrator.

Find the student in the User Management module, using the Search bar, or the Groups filters on the left. Select the student from the list, and click on Preview from above the list. This will open the Preview pane. In it there is an option Reset Password. Click on the tickbox, then click Save Changes at the bottom. The studentâ€™s password is now reset.
