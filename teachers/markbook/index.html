If a student’s name is highlighted in green, this means they have submitted the assignment and their score will display in the Score column. Clicking on the name of a student who has submitted either opens or downloads their submitted work, depending on whether the submission was an interactive test or a document. </p>
	                      		<p>The diagnostic report is for use with interactive tests, identifying exactly which questions students have been having problems with. The student’s mark per question will be set on a red background if they scored 0% for that question, on an orange background if they scored between 1-99% and on a green background if they scored 100%. This allows quick analysis of your class on a question by question basis. Clicking on the score for a question opens that screen of the student’s submitted interactive test.</p>
	                      		<p>For information about the circular icons, see <em>What do the self-selected confidence icons represent?</em> below. </p>
	                      		<p>If a student has ‘Incomplete Submission’ next to their name, it means that they have not yet handed in their assignment. If a student has ‘Incomplete Marking’ next to their name, it means that you need to mark their assignment. You will need to close the report and return to the main Markbook screen in order to mark the assignment. See <em>How do I give a mark to a student?</em> if you need help with this. Please note that the average group score is only calculated from students whose assignment has been both submitted and marked.</p>

If a student has scored 0% for that question, the box containing the score will be red. If a student has scored 1-99% for that question, the box will be orange. If a student has scored 100% for that question, the box will be green. This allows quick analysis of your class on a question by question basis.
