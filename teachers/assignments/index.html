						<p>Your <strong>students</strong> will not see any content, unless you release it to them by making an assignment.</p>

						<p>To <strong>open</strong> an item click once on the title. To find out more information about it <em>without</em> having to

						<p>To <strong>assign</strong> an item, first select an item from the list (using the checkbox to the left of the item title)

						<p><em>You must select an item labelled ‘Test’ in the Function column to make an assignment. You can select and assign a single ‘Test’ item, a single ‘Test' item with any number of ‘Support’ items, or a single ‘Package’.</em></p>

						<p>Once you have made an assignment, go to the Markbook tab for tracking, marking and reporting.</p>

						<p>To <strong>add</strong> your own content, use the Upload and Create buttons above the folder structure, to the top
						left of your screen.</p>

						<p>To <strong>preview, copy, edit, move</strong> or<strong> delete</strong>, first select an item from the list (using the checkbox to the
						left of the item title) then use the buttons above the list. You can preview and copy any item. Other
						functions will be unavailable unless the item belongs to you, so you may need to create a copy first.
						Some of these functions will only be available if a <em>single</em> item is selected.</p>

To invite an Administrator to your institution, click on the User Management tab and follow the instructions.</p><p>If your institution does have an Administrator but you still can’t assign work to your students, this means that the students have not yet been added to that course. To add students to a course, click on the User Management tab. Under the Manage Assignment Groups button to the top left of your screen, select the Add global groups to course option. Tick the groups that need to have access to the course, and click Save. You can check what students you have added to the course by clicking on the All Students filter. You will now be able to send assignments to those students</p>
